## NodeJs MaterialX Library Inspector

Application to examine MaterialX based materials from various publish libraries.
This inclides AMD GPU open, and AmbientCG currently.

Below are some sample materials packages that can be previewed and or downloaded as 
zip files. Note that any non MaterialX or non iage files (such as OpenUSD (usdc) files from AmbientCG) are not displayed in previews but are part of downloaded packages.

Note that some packages may take some time to download / preview due to the time it takes to download large flles (e.g. 8K images)
